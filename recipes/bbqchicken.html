    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of diced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic that is minced</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons of ketchup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of honey</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 pound of chicken wings</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and then saute until tender. Stir in the ketchup, honey, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Simmer until sauce has thickened slightly for about 1 or 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool for a minute.</li>
        <li>Dip chicken in sauce to coat on both sides; reserve remaining sauce in the skillet. Transfer chicken onto the preheated grill and cook, turning once, until nicely browned on all sides for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return the chicken to the skillet with the sauce. Simmer over medium heat until sticy for about 5 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.</li>
